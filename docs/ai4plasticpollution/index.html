In 1907, Belgian chemist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland">Leo Baekeland</a>, patented first fully synthetic plastic. 
He named it Bakelite. Then, by accident, polyethylene was discovered again in 1930s (after accidental invention in 1898). It‚Äôs first use was insulating radar cabling during 2nd world war. But soon, it was used in consumer products like tupperware, shopping bag, etc. But sadly, the properties of plastic which made it so useful, made it curse to our environment. A plastic bottle can last for more than 4 centuries in oceans. Then too, it only breaks down to microscopic particles and never really go away. <br/><br/>
Then came polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in 1973. It along with polyethylene bags and other plastics increased usage of single
use plastics by many folds. And our plastic problems got exponentially worse. Today, plastic pollution is one of the most critical 
environmental hazard. I think, most people will agree with me. Writing just about intensity of plastic  pollution can be a blog 
in itself. Today, this is not just environmental problem, but literally our problem. Scientists found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258">microplastic in our body too!!</a></div><div class="container is-max-desktop p-3 content">
Technology can help us fight this problem. And one such technology is ü•ÅMachine learningü•Å. There are many phases of plastic product in which ML can be helpful. Right from efficient packaging, tracking plastic wastes, separating plastic from other wastes, till it‚Äôs decomposition, ML is been used in every stage. Following is an overview of every stage which I‚Äôll talk about today. Click on stage, if u want to know more about it. <strong>WIP</strong>
